        <p>For a while, people have been playing less and less on the server, and at some point i checked analytics and found that I was the only person who even joined in two months. I decided I'd leave the server alone for a bit, and then I found out the people I hosted this server for have been playing on a Realm. After seeing that people are paying to play on a server, I thought this should be the end for Moobcraft, and now I've stopped paying for the moonbutt.club domain, and stopped running the game server so I can do other things with my machine resources. When the domain expires around Feburary, this site will disappear.</p>
