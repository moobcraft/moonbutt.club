        <h2>Server Rules</h2>
        <h3>Don't be a dick</h3>
        <p>
That means don't grief, and don't be disrespectful. You can swear and get
around bedrock's dumb filter, but if you cuss someone out you're just
going to look like some kid who's on their Xbox past 9 PM without their
mom knowing.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't cheat</h3>
        <p>
Mods like autoclickers, xray, and pvp bots if those even exist on bedrock
aren't strictly forbidden, as I can't really enforce that. But if you must
use these unfair mods, do your best not to ruin the experience for others.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't steal</h3>
        <p>
I know free stuff is tempting, but just don't dude. You can probably just
ask around for whatever you want in game chat or Discord, and someone nice
will help you out.
        </p>
        <p>
If you don't follow these rules, you might be set to Visitor, where you can't
interact with blocks, or "banned" as far as Bedrock allows me, which is really
just a hidden command block repeatedly running /kick because bedrock is dumb.
If you've been punished you can contact Cesium#5061 in the Discord server.
